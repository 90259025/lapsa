			<h1>Lapsa: Easy, Elegant Slides</h1>
			
			<p>Lapsa is the incredibly simple way to build beautiful and interactive presentations. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its layout and functionality, meaning easy things are easy and nearly anything is possible.</p>
			
			<p>Use the arrow keys (or enter or space) or tap with two fingers to move forward.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		
		<div class="slide">
			<h1>Build and Unbuild with Ease</h1>
			
			<p class="build">Give elements the <code>.build</code> class to make them appear one at a time...</p>
			
			<p data-build="1">...or set the <code>data-build</code> attribute to</p>
			
			<p data-build="1" style="text-align: center">choose</p>

		<div class="slide">
			<h1>Hassle-Free Navigation</h1>
			
			<p class="build">Move the cursor to the left edge or tap with three fingers to open the shelf, which contains more navigation options.</p>
			
			<p class="build">Single arrows move a build at a time, double arrows move a whole slide at a time, and the middle button opens the table view, which adapts to fit any screen size.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		
		<div id="theme-demonstration" class="slide">
			<h1>Bring Your Own Code</h1>
			
			<p class="build">Functional builds enable Lapsa slides to be as powerful as you can make them. Your own code runs when and where you want it, and extra information like target durations for animations means they can look great with Lapsa&#x2019;s built-in features.</p>
			
			<p class="build">Lapsa is styled with plain and simple CSS, so the default look of the slides is nothing more than a suggestion &mdash; and the possibilities really are endless.</p>
